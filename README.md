## My goals in JS lessons

To make a list, click - and a list button will be shown, as below:

- Master strings, numbers, conditions, basic functions before September

### This is a third headline (marked with #s)

- md means markdown
  To organize things, add letters (a, b, c) or numbers (1, 2, 3)
  a) something
  b) another thing
  c) yet again

  or you could do something like

  1. name
  2. age
  3. title

#### This is how to make a fourth headline

Write something here to. Right-click the tab above of the readme file and click preview to see how it shows in the file/browser.

you can also write JS (backtick turns the note into a code block and adding js to it, makes the colors visible):

```js
let name = "Maria";
alert(name);
```

without the js:

```
let name = "Maria";
alert(name);
```

without the backticks:
let name = "Maria";
alert(name);

This text will be **bold**.

This txt will be _italics_

If you want to highlight the term use backticks like `that`.
